Here weâ€™ll be doing data visualization with the help of a case study:

We'll be using a Google Playstore dataset to analyse what are the factors affecting the visibility of the apps.
And try to answer the following questions :-
- Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps? 
- Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
